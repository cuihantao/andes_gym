# OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized.
# OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program.
# That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results.
# The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library.
# As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.
# For more information, please see http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/.
